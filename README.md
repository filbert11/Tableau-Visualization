## Background
Every year, the Gallup World Poll measures life satisfaction ratings and emotional wellbeing of how people feel about their lives and what's happening in them. These measures capture the important life context that GDP does not explain. Using the data from the poll, the world happiness report is published by Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

Objective: to provide recommendation for countries to improve their happiness score (life ladder).

The data is retrieved from https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2023/#appendices-and-data

## Summary
It is observed that countries with high life ladder are America, Europe, Australia and Brazil and Countries with low life ladder are Africa and South Asia (e.g., India, Iran, Pakistan, etc.) countries.

Countries that have low life ladder in the past 5-year (2012-2016) tends to have low life ladder (7 out of 15 countries) in the next 5-year (2017-2021). On the other hand, countries with high life ladder tends to have high life ladder (12 out of 15 countries remains the top life ladder countries). It seems that countries who perform well tends to continue to perform well.
Note: 15 countries appear as top 10 / bottom 10 countries due to the countries have same life ladder score.

To find out how country can improve its life ladder, we study from the country that has the highest improvement in the past decade. In this scenario, we study from Hungary and we compare it with Lebanon which has the highest decline.

From the time series of the characteristics of top improvement and decline countries, we can observe that top improvement country increased its gdp, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices and generosity while lowered its negative affect and perceptions of corruptions in the past decade. On the other hand, top decline country decreased its gdp, social support, freedom to make life choices, positive affect and generosity while increasing its negative affect. Both top improvement and decline country increased its healthy life expectancy across time suggesting that overall healthy life improvement across the world which maybe due to better medicine and vaccination.

## Conclusion and Recommendation
For countries to improve its happiness, it requires consistent effort across decade. To learn from the top improvement countries, a country should improve its gdp, freedom to make life choices, generosity while lowering down its perceptions of corruption.
